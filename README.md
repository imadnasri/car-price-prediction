# 🚗 Car Price Prediction  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict car prices based on various features such as year, mileage, fuel type, and brand. The dataset is preprocessed, and a trained model is saved for future predictions.

## 📊 How the Model Works  
- The dataset is **cleaned** (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).  
- Data is **split into training and testing sets**.  
- A **Machine Learning model** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) is trained.  
- The **trained model is saved using Pickle** for future predictions.  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Add more advanced models (**XGBoost, LightGBM, Deep Learning**).  
- Deploy the model using **Flask** or **Streamlit** to create a web app.  
- Optimize the preprocessing pipeline for better efficiency.  
- Implement a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
